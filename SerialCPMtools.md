# Experimental Fast file transfer 

### This is _very_ experimental at the moment

Currently this is only supported with the RC2040 PCB from ExtremeKits. https://extkits.co.uk/product/rc2040/

By pressing the "BUT" button, the USB Serial port is freed to use with a set of tools for file transfer, directory listing and file delete
The PCB LED is set to show the RC2040 is in this mode. 

The programs are detailed here https://github.com/ExtremeElectronics/RC20XX-file-transfer-programs and should run with most installs of python 3
(Currently Linux is untested, but I can't see why it shouldn't work) 

To return back to the emulation. Run the EXIT-RC20xx.py program.

# Experimental Fast file transfer 

### This is _very_ experimental at the moment

By pressing the "BUT" button, the USB Serial port is freed to use with a set of tools for file transfer, listing and delete
The PCB LED is set to show the RC2040 is in this mode. 

The programs are detailed here https://github.com/ExtremeElectronics/RC20XX-file-transfer-programs and should run with most installs of python 3
(Currently Linux is untested, but I can't see why it shouldn't work)

# RC2040
Z80 emulation of RC2014 using the RP2040 processor 

Initial aim was to get the EtchedPixels (https://github.com/EtchedPixels) linux based z80 emulation including an SD Card based IDE running on a Pi Pico as a standalone.
I have ripped out much of EtchedPixels's great work, to which I'm truely sorry, but I was only interested in the Z80 emulation, and I needed to get it to fit in an RP2040

Now looking at documenting it and adding "usefull" stuff to the build

Huge thanks goes to EtchedPixels, Grant Searle , Mitch Lalovic and Spencer Owen(Rc2014) for collating, modifying and allowing us to play with their software.

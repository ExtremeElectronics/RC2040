libz80 - Z80 emulation library 
===============================

The original one appears to be dead - at least nobody responded to the
emulatuon bug so this is a fork that actually gets 16bit math flags correct
in the corner cases where the standard version leaves Z incorrectly clear.

Building and Installing
-----------------------

The Makefile creates `libz80.so`, which together with `z80.h` make up the binary
package. `make install` installs these files in `/usr/lib` and `/usr/include`
respectively.

Emulation code itself is generated by the `codegen` directory. `mktables.spec`
includes a specification of the opcodes, using regular expressions to express
similar opcodes in a compact way. Binary representation of the opcodes is listed
in `opcodes.lst`. This makes tweaking the 'processor' relatively easy, as it
isn't done manually.

Pre-generated files are included - these are `opcodes_decl.h`, `opcodes_table.h`
and `opcodes_impl.c` in the `codegen` directory.

The `tests` directory includes a simple test framework and a few tests to ensure
the current behavior of the processor.
